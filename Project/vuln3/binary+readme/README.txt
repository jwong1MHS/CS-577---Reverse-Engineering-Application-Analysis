Run the program in the directory with `./binary3`.
The program will ask for two total inputs: a first
name string and an id number.

Goal of the red team:
There are vulnerabilities in the program that can be triggered.
The way that you know you found one of the vulnerabilities
is if a string is printed on the console that says
"Yikes! You found the ___ vulnerability!", where the ___
is the nth vulnerability of that program.
There is one vulnerability that doesn't have a string printed
however, and the program will abort with an error.
